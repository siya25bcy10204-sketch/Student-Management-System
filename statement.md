## Problem Statement
Managing student records manually becomes difficult when the number of students increases. Things like adding new students, updating their details,delete of details or searching for a specific student take more time and can also lead to mistakes. To make this easier, there is a need for a small system that can store basic student information and help perform these tasks quickly so we use python .

## Scope of the Project
The scope of this project is limited to handling basic student details such as name, ID, age, and course. The system allows users to add new students, update their information, delete records, search for a particular student, and view the full list. This project is simple and does not include advanced features like authentication or large database support. It is mainly focused on understanding basic data handling in Python.

## Target Users
This project can be useful for:
- Teachers who want to maintain a list of students as normally it is difficult but python makes it easy.
- Small coaching centers 
- Students who want to practice data management concepts
- Anyone learning the basics of Python programs

## High-Level Features
- Add new student information
- Edit existing student details
- Remove a student record
- Search a student by ID or name
- Display all saved student records in a simple list
